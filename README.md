# Web Development Midterm 
## CptS 489, Spring 2023 at WSU
### Grade: 100% (69% average)

<br>
We were given <b>55 minutes</b> total to find our assigned web pages, recreate the web page, and submit our work.

I was assigned this [content](https://school.eecs.wsu.edu/faculty/profile/?nid=shira) university faculty page 
and this [design](https://ece.princeton.edu/people/ravindra-n-bhatt) university faculty page.

The goal was to recreate the design page but replace the professor with text and images from the content page.

Below are the results of my midterm compared to the content page.
